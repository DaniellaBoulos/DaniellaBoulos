Welcome to Hell Bound

Hello, as you know Zeus sent you on a mission to retrieve his lightning bolt that his brother, Hades, stole and is keeping in the Underworld. You went as instructed and had the lightning bolt in your hand, but as you were leaving, Persephone and her hellhound, Cerberus, caught you. They brought you to Hades, he took back the lightning bolt and threw you into the dungeon. You managed to escape the dungeon, but now must find a way out of hell.

1. Take path on the left
2. Take path on the right
3. Go straight down the hallway
You find yourself in a hallway with three different paths. Which path do you take?2
You walk through this path with no issues and you see a light up ahead that you hope is your way out.

1. Grab the sword
2. Grab the nunchucks
3. Grab the bow and arrows
At the end of the path, you end up in the armory. You may need a weapon for later. Which weapon do you take?1
You pick up the sword, it’s heavier than it looks, so you decide to drag it. Hades hears you. He snuck up on you and stabbed you in the gut with the sword.

1. Take path on the left
2. Take path on the right
3. Go straight down the hallway
You find yourself in a hallway with three different paths. Which path do you take?1
This path is crawling with spiders and bats that are chasing you, but thankfully you manage to outrun them.

1. Take the spiral staircase up
2. Take the slide down
You make it out of the hallway and see two different paths. Which do you take?2
You take the slide down, and fall onto the edge of the building, but manage to catch yourself. You start walking, looking for another path that could potentially lead you out.

1. Take the right tunnel
2. Take the left tunnel
You walk up to two different tunnels that both seem pretty dark. Which tunnel do you take?1
At first the tunnel was pitch black, but as you walked further in there were beautiful bioluminescent crystals that lit up the tunnel so much so that you could see. As you get closer to the end of the tunnel it’s brighter. You walk through the blinding light and realize you’re on soil, back on Earth. Congrats! You made it out of hell.
